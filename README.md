# Cognitive Neurosience (COGS) Degree Project

For my degree, I am required to do a research internship program in which I assist in research for a graduate student. I chose to "intern" for research in gambling at the Centre for Gambling Research at the University of British Columbia and these python files are the statistical analysis I pursued. All of the work I contributed towards and the results are in a paper for which I will upload after I'm done; the report was written in Latex.

_Unfortunately, I hadn't initialized this repository until near the end because I thought it would be a small project in which the python files would allow me to do statistical analysis._
Ever since then, I have pursued NLP (Natural Language Processing) via the nltk package in python, Exploratory Factor Analysis, and other statistics which made this "small" project acrue a fairly decent amount of code. Admittedly, the NLP portion of the analysis didn't provide meaningful results which could be due to the large variance of self-reports by the participants. The validity analysis used was convergent such that the scale being developed was compared against existing scales for which participants also gave responses for; this was done through the pearson correlation coefficient as outlined in the final report pdf.

My purpose of this is purely to showcase my work since I've been frustrated enough to learn a few things which is, I think, the most important thing in my career at the moment.
