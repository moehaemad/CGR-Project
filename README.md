# COGS402_School_Project

For my degree, I am required to do a sort of research internship program in which I assist in research for a graduate student. I chose to "intern" for research in gambling and these python files are the statistical analysis I pursued. All of the work I contributed towards and the results are in a paper for which I will upload after I'm done.

### Unfortunately, I hadn't initialized this repository until now because I thought it would be a small project in which the python files would allow me to do statistical analysis ###
Ever Since then, I have pursued NLP (Natural Language Processing) via the nltk package in python, Exploratory Factor Analysis, and other statistics which made this "small" project acrue a fairly decent amount of code.

My purpose of this is purely to showcase my work since I've been frustrated enough to learn a few things which is, I think, the most important thing in my career at the moment.
